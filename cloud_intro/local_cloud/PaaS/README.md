# Run and modify a simple PaaS

For learning the concept of PaaS, two excercises are given. In both cases, you need to use the VM that we have created in the IaaS part, but we will interact differently with it now.

In this case, a pre-made service will be created for you, so you only need to modify a few things and the infrastructure will do the rest for you. In this way, you only have to focus on the code, and not the installation and maintainance of libraries and packages.
